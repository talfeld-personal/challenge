    <h1>Payment Processing Analysis - Key Assumptions</h1>
    
    <h2>1. January Data Exclusion</h2>
    <p><strong>Assumption:</strong> January represents the company's launch period and should be excluded from the main analysis.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Very small transaction amounts (likely test transactions or contractor payments)</li>
        <li>All chargebacks occurred in January, suggesting early customer issues</li>
        <li>Customers may not have been fully legitimate during launch phase</li>
        <li>No chargebacks after January indicates stabilization</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Analysis focuses on February-June operational data. Since the main decline is in June, removing January doesn't affect the core problem investigation.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Card-on-File Transaction Model</h2>
    <p><strong>Assumption:</strong> Most transactions are card-on-file (saved payment methods) rather than manual card entry.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>CVV data is missing for the vast majority of transactions</li>
        <li>CVV is typically required for manual card entry</li>
        <li>Absence suggests automated/programmatic payment processing</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> CVV analysis is excluded since it's not applicable to this transaction model.</p>
